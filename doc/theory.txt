		projection to 2D triangle
	Saving connections between triangles
		finding triangles with exactly two common triangles
		calculating the angle between (outward facing) face normals
	Insetting the triangles in order to enable building concave shapes

Connectors
	explaining why we make different connectors depending on anlge

Packing
	well, the reasoning behind the packing algorithm

Drawing
	placement of holes on edges
